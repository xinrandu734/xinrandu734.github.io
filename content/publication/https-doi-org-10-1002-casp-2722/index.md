abstract: "Abstract Wellbeing issues among international students in the UK higher
  education have been recognised as a crisis. To address this, we integrate social
  identity and felt understanding approaches to wellbeing and mental health, testing
  whether felt understanding (the belief that others understand oneself) is an important
  process through which social identity predicts better wellbeing, over and above
  other, more established mediators (social support, life meaning, and personal control).
  International university students (including both undergraduates and postgraduates,
  N = 301) completed an online survey that measured three sets of variables: social
  identity variables (ingroup identification, multiple identities, multiple identity
  compatibility); process variables (social support, felt understanding, life meaning,
  personal control); and wellbeing outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress). Path
  analyses confirmed that felt understanding predicted better wellbeing outcomes over
  and above the other mediators. Additionally, indirect effects from social identity
  variables to wellbeing via felt understanding were consistently significant, even
  when adjusting for the other mediators. The results are consistent with the idea
  that felt understanding is an under-acknowledged resource through which social identities
  protect wellbeing. The findings contribute to “social cure” research and have implications
  for promoting wellbeing services from the perspective of group memberships. Please

  Social Impact Statement."
